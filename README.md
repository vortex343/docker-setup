## Setup Instructions

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose with all dependencies.
2. If a service requires environment variables, start it with:

```bash
sudo docker compose --env-file .env up -d
```

Run this command in the respective service directory.

3. For services that do not require a `.env` file, simply run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
